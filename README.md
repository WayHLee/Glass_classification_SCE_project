# Glass_classification_SCE_project
  This is the first time I'm trying to use GitHub to upload my code. I hope this might offer you at least a little help.
1 : What the project does--
  This is the project for my course SCE, mainly focusing on developing a classification model for a dataset that contains some ancient glasses samples into 2 catogories. 
2 : Why the project is useful--
  For code, this article involves logistic regression model, decision tree classification model, support vector machine classification model. At the same time, a relatively new component data processing method, namely the center log ratio method, is also applied. These contents should have a certain enlightenment effect.
  For archaeology, this model established could help to date the samples and get a insight into the dynasty this glass sample comes from. 
3 : How users can get started with the project--
  Download this repository. The "data.xlsx" is the data we will use. The 3 yml files are for version control. Run "main.ipynb" via jupyter notebook, you will get to the path I went through. 
4 : Who maintains and contributes to the project--
  The dataset is provided by High Education Press,PRC.  
  The project is maintained by Viktor Lee.
